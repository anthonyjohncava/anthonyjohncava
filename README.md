👋 Hi, I’m Anthony Cava.
🎓I'm a recent software development graduate from the University of South Australia.
Now that I have a lot of free time, I am currently working towards building projects that I'm truly passionate about. 😀

👀 I’m interested in mobile app development, games development, and machine learning.

🌱 I’m currently learning Swift to build iOS apps. My goal is to publish my first app this year!
